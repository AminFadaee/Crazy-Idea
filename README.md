# Here's A Crazy Idea!
## Intro
This is a simple project for generating random ideas.
If you want to work on a story,
do some improve or are just plain curious about how different things can mix together,
you are in the right place.

A while ago,
I wrote a short script while working on a project to generate random names.
I did this by pairing a random adjective with a random name.
I didn't want to delete the lists I created for this script; 
therefore, I added them here with a list of activities and another for locations.
You can find all the lists in the `lists` folder:
* activity
* adjective
* location
* person

Feel free to fork or send me merge request for crazy items in the lists!


## Details
The random idea is generated like this:

> {random adjective} {random person} in {random location} {random activity}



## Run
Run the program by running main.go:
```bash
go run main/main.go
```
